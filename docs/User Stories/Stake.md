### User Story: Opening New TitanX Stakes through the DragonX Contract

#### Title: Initiating TitanX Staking in the DragonX Ecosystem

#### Description
As a user of the DragonX ecosystem, I want to be able to open new TitanX stakes through the DragonX contract using the TitanX vault. This process should allow for staking under specific conditions and ensure that stakes are managed for maximum benefit, adhering to the 'bigger pays better' bonus principle.

#### Requirements
- **Preconditions**: The function must ensure:
  - The active DragonStake contract has not exceeded the maximum number of stakes per wallet.
  - There are sufficient TitanX tokens in the vault to start a stake, or the cooldown period for stake opening has elapsed.

- **Process Flow**:
  1. **Stake Limit Check**: Confirm that the DragonStake contract hasn't exceeded the maximum allowed stakes per wallet.
  2. **Vault Update and Token Check**: Update the vault status and check if there are sufficient TitanX tokens available for staking.
  3. **Stake Initiation Based on Vault Balance**: 
     - If the vault has enough tokens to achieve the maximum 'bigger pays better' bonus, initiate the stake.
     - If the vault lacks sufficient TitanX, verify if the cooldown period has passed to allow for token accumulation.
  4. **Stake Opening and Cooldown Management**: Open the stake and, if necessary, set the cooldown period for the next possible stake.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- The function should only execute if the DragonStake contract is within the stake limit and either sufficient tokens are available or the cooldown period has elapsed.
- TitanX stakes must be opened correctly, adhering to the 'bigger pays better' bonus when applicable.
- The function should handle the cooldown period correctly, allowing stake openings only after sufficient token accumulation.
- The function should be secure and prevent potential exploits, ensuring a stable and trustworthy staking environment.

### User Story: Collecting and Managing Fees from Liquidity Pool

#### Title: Efficient Management of Liquidity Pool Fees

#### Description
As a user in the DragonX ecosystem, I need a function `collectFees()` that allows me to collect fees accumulated in the initial liquidity pool, consisting of DragonX and TitanX tokens. This function should effectively manage these collected fees by burning DragonX tokens and making TitanX tokens useable for staking within the DragonX ecosystem.

#### Requirements
- **Preconditions**: The function should ensure:
  - The contract addresses for DragonX and TitanX are set and valid.
  - The function is non-reentrant to prevent reentrancy attacks.

- **Process Flow**:
  1. **Identification of Caller**: Retrieve the address of the function caller.
  2. **Fee Collection**: Call the internal `_collectFees()` function to determine the amounts of DragonX and TitanX collected from the pool.
  3. **Fee Allocation**: Appropriately assign the collected amounts to `dragon` and `titan` variables, depending on the token order in the pool.
  4. **State Update**: Update the total fees and burnt tokens state variables (`totalDragonFeesBurned`, `totalTitanFeeCollected`, `totalDragonBurned`).
  5. **DragonX Token Burning**: Burn the collected DragonX tokens using the `burn` method of the DragonX contract.
  6. **TitanX Token Transfer for Staking**: Transfer the collected TitanX tokens to the DragonX address for staking purposes.
  7. **Vault Update**: Update the DragonX vault to reflect the new token balances and staking status.
  8. **Event Emission**: Emit a `CollectedFees` event with details of the collected amounts and the caller's address.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- The function should only execute successfully when all preconditions are satisfied.
- Accurate amounts of DragonX and TitanX fees must be collected and allocated correctly.
- State variables should reflect the updated values post-transaction.
- The DragonX tokens collected must be burned successfully.
- The TitanX tokens must be transferred correctly for staking purposes.
- The DragonX vault should be updated to reflect these changes accurately.
- The `CollectedFees` event should be emitted with the correct details of the transaction.
- The function should maintain high security standards to prevent any vulnerabilities, including reentrancy attacks.

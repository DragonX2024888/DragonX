### User Story: Deploying a New DragonStake Contract Instance

#### Title: Dynamic Expansion of Staking Capacity in DragonX Ecosystem

#### Description
As a user of the DragonX ecosystem, I want to have the ability to deploy a new DragonStake contract instance when the number of open stakes in the current active instance reaches the maximum limit per wallet. This ensures that the staking capacity can dynamically expand to accommodate growing user participation.

#### Requirements
- **Preconditions**: The function must ensure:
  - The current number of open stakes in the active DragonStake instance has reached the maximum allowed per wallet.
  - The function is only callable externally to maintain controlled access.

- **Process Flow**:
  1. **Stake Count Validation**: Check if the current active DragonStake contract has reached the maximum number of stakes per wallet.
  2. **Conditional Contract Deployment**: 
     - If the maximum stake count is reached, deploy a new DragonStake contract instance to accommodate additional stakes.
     - If the condition is not met, revert the transaction with an appropriate message (NoNeedForNewDragonStakeInstance).

#### Acceptance Criteria
- The function should only execute if the current active DragonStake contract has reached its stake capacity.
- A new DragonStake contract instance must be deployed successfully when the conditions are met.
- The transaction should revert if there is no need for a new instance, ensuring resource efficiency.
- The deployment process should be secure and accessible only to authorized external callers.
- The function should maintain the integrity and scalability of the staking system within the DragonX ecosystem.
